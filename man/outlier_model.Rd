outlier_model(A, adj, nsim = 1000, ncores = 1, meta_name = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Character Matrix (data)}

\item{adj}{Adjacency list of a decomposable graph}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores to use in parallelization}

\item{meta_name}{A meta name to keep track of different outlier models}
}
\description{
A model based on decomposable graphical models for outlier detection
}
\details{
It is assumed that all cell values in \code{df}, for all variables,
are represented as a single character. No check for this is done in the
current version. If cell values are not single characters, one may
exploit \code{letters} and \code{LETTERS} e.g.
