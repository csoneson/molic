# molic: Multivariate OutLIerdetection In Contingency Tables
An **R** package to perform outlier detection in contingency tables using decomposable graphical models; models for which the underlying association between all variables can be depicted by an undirected graph. The main functions are described below.

### Outlier Detection
A model based on decomposable graphical models for outlier detection.
 
- `outlier_model(A, adj, nsim = 1000, ncores = 1, meta_name = "", validate_A = TRUE)`

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```A```     |     Character matrix (data)
```adj```     |     Adjacency list of a decomposable graph
```nsim```     |     Number of simulations
```ncores```     |     Number of cores to use in parallelization
```meta_name```     |     A meta name to keep track of different outlier models
```validate_A```     |     If TRUE, it is checked if all values in A are characters with `nchar == 1` (which is required)

It is assumed that all cell values in `A` , for all are represented as a single character. If `validate_A` is `TRUE` this is checked. If cell values are not single characters, one may exploit `letters` and `LETTERS` e.g.

### Model Selection in DGMs

Efficient forward selection in decomposable graphical models.

- `efs(df, x = efs_init(df), trace = TRUE, stop_crit = "mdl", thres = 5)`

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```df```     |     data.frame
```x```     |     A efs object
```trace```     |     Logical indicating whether or not to trace the procedure
```stop_crit```     |     Stopping criterion ("mdl", "aic" or "bic")
```thres```     |     A threshold mechanism for choosing between two different ways of calculating the entropy. Can Speed up the procedure with the "correct" value.

Use `efs_adj_list` or `efs_adj_matrix` to extract the fitted graph.

### Simulation 

- `dgm_sim(A, adj, nsim = 1000, ncores = 1)`:

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```A```     |     Character matrix (data)
```adj```     |     Adjacency list of a decomposable graph
```nsim```     |     Number of simulations
```ncores```     |     Number of cores to use in parallelization

This function returns a matrix of dimension `nsim x ncol(A)` where each row correspond to a simulated observation from a DGM represented by `adj`.
