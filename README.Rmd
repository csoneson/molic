# molic: Multivariate OutLIerdetection In Contingency Tables
An **R** package to perform outlier detection in contingency tables using decomposable graphical models; models for which the underlying association between all variables can be depicted by an undirected graph. The main functions are described below.

### Outlier Detection

- `outlier_model(A, adj, nsim = 1000, ncores = 1, meta_name = "")` 

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```A```     |     Character Matrix (data)
```adj```     |     Adjacency list of a decomposable graph
```nsim```     |     Number of simulations
```ncores```     |     Number of cores to use in parallelization
```meta_name```     |     A meta name to keep track of different outlier models

The function fits an outlier model from which outlier detection can be conducted

### Model Selection in DGMs

- `efs(df, x = efs_init(df), trace = TRUE, stop_crit = "mdl1", thres = 5)`:

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```df```     |     Dataframe
```x```     |     An efs object
```trace```     |     Logical indidcating whether or not to trace the procedure
```stop_crit```     |     Stopping criterion (mdl1, mdl2, aic or bic)
```thres```     |     A threshold mechanism for choosing between two different ways of calculating the entropy

Efficient forward selection in decomposable graphical models. It is for example used to obtain the input graph `adj` in `outlier_model`.

### Simulation 

- `dgm_sim(A, adj, nsim = 1000, ncores = 1)`:

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```A```     |     Character Matrix (data)
```adj```     |     Adjacency list of a decomposable graph
```nsim```     |     Number of simulations
```ncores```     |     Number of cores to use in parallelization

This function returns a matrix of dimension `nsim x ncol(A)` where each row correspond to a simulated observation from a DGM represented by `adj`.

### Example
