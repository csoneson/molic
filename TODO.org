#+STARTUP: showall
* Todo Cpp
 - [ ] Use adjacency lists in ~efs_step~
 - [ ] Implement as_mat and
 - [X] Implement as_adj (R version)

* Todo Outliers [8/15]
 - [ ] In outlier_model handle na_b when names in b are longer than one char!
   + Just assumme or convert these!
 - [ ] Benchmark the two mdl approaches and AIC;
   + how many false edges (edges between haps especially)
   + in how many component/haps are all SNPs included; take into account the independent singletons.
 - [ ] Implement outlier_test function
 - [ ] Sensitivity analysis of paramter ~d~ in efs
 - [ ] Benchmark speed to Altmueller on the same datasets
 - [ ] Implement backward search and update eligibles accordingly
 - [X] Implement new marginal table function
 - [X] Implement new slice function
 - [X] Handle empty separators
 - [X] Run the outlier_model on ONE graph - so ONLY 10.000 simulations are needed.
 - [X] Implement for parrallel for both Windows and Linux! library(parallel) ?
 - [X] Implement that the union of componentlist into a single graph
 - [X] Redesign maximum cardinality to input the neighbor matrix G_A
 - [X] The new neighborhood function is easy implementet with G_A
