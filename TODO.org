#+STARTUP: showall
* Todo [8/14]
 - [X] Implement new marginal table function
 - [X] Implement new slice function
 - [X] Handle empty separators
 - [X] Run the outlier_model on ONE graph - so ONLY 10.000 simulations are needed.
 - [X] Implement for parrallel for both Windows and Linux! library(parallel) ?
 - [X] Implement that the union of componentlist into a single graph
 - [X] Redesign maximum cardinality to input the neighbor matrix G_A
 - [X] The new neighborhood function is easy implementet with G_A
 - [ ] In efs: Convert colnames to x1 - xn and back again and bench runningtime (to increase speed!
   + Also, is it safe to split edges, x1|x2, on "|". What if a variable is called abc|def?
 - [ ] In outlier_model handle na_b when names in b are longer than one char!
 - [ ] Implement outlier_test function
 - [ ] Sensitivity analysis of paramter ~d~ in efs
 - [ ] Benchmark speed to Altmueller on the same datasets
 - [ ] Implement backward search and update eligibles accordingly

* COMPREX (Another outlierdetection method for discrete data)
